# Changelog

All notable changes to Codexion will be documented in this file.

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once public releases begin.

## Unreleased

## 0.3.3 - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Restore the quota and Issue Inbox controls to the active chat title bar after Codex changed the
  Open in button markup and introduced multi-panel title-bar action groups.
- Detect the visible title bar without assuming it occupies the right half of the full application
  window, which keeps the controls attached to the chat when Review or other side panels are open.
- Keep quota, Issue Inbox, and native title-bar actions in one stable container with the native 6px
  spacing across both Open in and Summary layouts.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Add a native-style File Access section to Codexion Settings with a direct link to macOS Full Disk
  Access and an explicit workspace rescan action.

### Fixed

- Stop background Issue Inbox polling from repeatedly touching the same workspace directories and
  triggering recurring macOS file-access prompts.
- Defer Desktop, Documents, and Downloads workspace inspection until the user explicitly requests a
  rescan, while continuing to discover ordinary Codex workspaces automatically.
- Persist successful repository mappings and inspected workspace roots without overwriting
  concurrent Issue Inbox settings changes.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Add a native-style Maintenance section to Codexion Settings with the installed Core version and
  a one-click action to restart the Codexion background companion without restarting Codex Desktop.

### Fixed

- Enforce that the Settings/Core version matches `package.json` during CI so packaged releases
  cannot display a stale hard-coded version again.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Automatically detect when Codex restarts without its CDP endpoint, restore the required launch
  configuration, reconnect to the new renderer, and rehydrate quota and Issue Inbox state.
- Restart the companion Core when an already-running Codexion app is opened again, and write its
  diagnostics to `~/Library/Application Support/Codexion/codexion.log`.

### Changed

- Place quota and Issues inside the native Open in action container with full rectangular hit areas,
  native spacing, and explicit non-draggable title-bar behavior.
- Make Issue window changes immediate and persistent, and use Codex's native right-aligned checkmark
  instead of a selected-row background in its dropdown.
- Reduce and offset the Issues count badge so the circle-dot symbol remains clearly visible.

### Fixed

- Preserve the Codexion Settings page and its single native sidebar selection while Codex rebuilds
  the Settings navigation.
- Fall back to a forced application restart when Codex accepts but does not complete a normal quit,
  allowing Codexion to restore CDP reliably.
- Keep quota hovercards and Issues hover and click behavior active across the complete control bounds.

## 0.2.8 - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Anchor quota and GitHub Issues before the native Open in control so all three participate in the
  same dynamically sized title-bar action group when the side panel opens or closes.
- Keep the GitHub Issues trigger interactive inside the title bar's pointer-transparent layout
  container so its tooltip and menu continue to work with the side panel visible.
- Use the circle-dot Issues symbol for the inbox trigger and panel title, reserving the GitHub mark
  for actions that actually open GitHub.
- Reuse Codex's native Usage speedometer geometry for the quota indicator.

## 0.2.7 - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Give the GitHub Issue trigger a real 28px flex footprint so it cannot overlap adjacent title-bar
  controls when the side panel changes the available layout.
- Anchor the quota hovercard below the quota's right edge so it expands left and remains fully
  visible with either side-panel state.

## 0.2.6 - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Make the quota hovercard deterministic in the draggable title bar by tracking the pointer against
  the complete quota and hovercard bounds instead of relying on fragile enter and leave events.

## 0.2.5 - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Bind the rich quota tooltip to the full quota trigger hit area so it appears reliably in the
  native title bar, and reduce its hover delay.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Add a compact tooltip to the GitHub Issue trigger and a richer quota tooltip with the active
  account, email, remaining weekly allowance, plan, reset time, and a link to Tibo on X.

### Fixed

- Place only the quota meter before every native control group in the complete right-side title-bar
  action rail, while keeping the GitHub Issue Inbox in its original control group.
- Isolate the GitHub Issue trigger from the native pinned-summary tooltip wrapper so hovering it
  cannot open a misplaced native tooltip.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Keep the quota meter at the left edge of the right-side title-bar action group, followed by the
  GitHub Issue Inbox and then Codex's native controls.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Keep the quota meter and Issue Inbox attached to the visible right-side title-bar action group
  across both the previous and current Codex Desktop button layouts.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Locate Homebrew GitHub CLI installations when Codexion is launched from Finder with the minimal
  macOS GUI `PATH`.
- Show the installed Codexion version at the bottom of its Settings page.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Signed Sparkle 2 automatic updates for packaged macOS releases.
- Checksum-pinned Sparkle dependency retrieval and signed appcast generation in the release workflow.

### Changed

- Moved the weekly quota indicator from the crowded sidebar footer to the native title-bar action
  group, using a compact speedometer icon and remaining percentage.
- Made Developer ID signing resilient to transient Apple timestamp service failures.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Safe macOS lifecycle coordinator for launching Codex Desktop with loopback CDP.
- `start`, `attach`, and `doctor` CLI commands.
- Codex app-server provider using `account/rateLimits/read` and `account/read`.
- Native-style weekly usage enhancement integrated into the sidebar profile trigger.
- GitHub Issue Inbox backed by the local authenticated `gh` CLI.
- Codexion Settings page with repository filtering, multi-selection, and workspace detection.
- Durable issue-to-thread mapping with interrupted task-start recovery.
- Contributor, security, extension, and architecture documentation.

### Changed

- Repositioned Codexion from a Codex Plugin to an independent local Companion.
- Separated usage data retrieval from CDP UI injection.
- Reconnect to the main renderer after CDP session loss and reinstall the Widget automatically.
- Restart the owned app-server usage provider after failures and prevent stderr backpressure.
- Show the remaining weekly percentage over a full-width progress track while preserving the
  native profile menu behavior.
- Read the current non-secret account identity without retaining authentication material.

### Removed

- Plugin manifests and `SessionStart` hook launcher.
- Renderer request to the obsolete `/wham/usage` endpoint.
